Forecasting with Linear Regression
Contents
EDA - A very brief EDA, showing only the essentials
Aggregating Categorical Variables - A continuation of the EDA, showing that we should be able to forecast the aggregated time series (daily total sales) and then disaggregate the forecasts based on historical proportions without penalising performance
Total Sales Forecast - Forecast the total number of sales across all categorical variables using Linear Regression for 2021.
Product Sales Ratio Forecast - Forecast the ratio of sales between products for 2021
Dissagregating Total Sales Forecast - Disagreggate the Total Sales forecasts, to get the forecast for each categorical variable

Observations:
There are 3 categorical columns that together describe a univariate time series. Country, Store and Product.
Lets see which countries, stores and products we have data for:
In [4]:
def val_count_df(df, column_name, sort_by_column_name=False):
    value_count = df[column_name].value_counts().reset_index().rename(columns={column_name:"Value Count","index":column_name}).set_index(column_name)
    value_count["Percentage"] = df[column_name].value_counts(normalize=True)*100
    value_count = value_count.reset_index()
    if sort_by_column_name:
        value_count = value_count.sort_values(column_name)
    return value_count



def plot_and_display_valuecounts(df, column_name, sort_by_column_name=False):
    val_count = val_count_df(df, column_name, sort_by_column_name)
    #display(val_count)
    val_count.set_index(column_name).plot.pie(y="Value Count", figsize=(5,5), legend=False, ylabel="");

Every group seems to occur in equal amounts, but lets double check to see if every country contains every store, and if every store sells each product:
In [8]:
train_df.groupby(["country","store","product"])["num_sold"].count()

Yes, every country contains every store and every store contains every product. This gives us 48 univariate time series all of length 1461

We have 4 years of data from 2017-01-01 to 2020-12-31 to train occuring at daily frequency.
We are required to forecast 1 year of data, from 2021-01-01 to 2021-12-31

Observations:
The year 2020 is significantly different to other years, with sales being almost identical between countries.
Each product has a different pattern in number of sales.
It looks a lot like the pattern in sales between stores is identical. With KaggleMart and KaggleRama following the same pattern but with KaggleRama having less sales.
Similarly it looks like the pattern in sales between all countries is identical, just with the magnitude of sales being different.
Aggregating Time Series
First we need to show that its a good idea to aggregate the time series across each of the three categorical variables: Store, Country and Product.
Store
Lets test to see if the pattern between stores is the same, regardless of product or country.
In [14]:
store_weights = train_df.groupby("store")["num_sold"].sum()/train_df["num_sold"].sum()
store_weights
Out[14]:
store
KaggleMart    0.742515
KaggleRama    0.257485
Name: num_sold, dtype: float64
In [15]:
store_ratio_over_time = (train_df.groupby(["date","store"])["num_sold"].sum() / train_df.groupby(["date"])["num_sold"].sum()).reset_index()
f,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20,10))
sns.lineplot(data = store_ratio_over_time, x="date", y="num_sold", hue="store");
ax.set_ylabel("Proportion of sales");
KaggleMart appears to consistantly have ~74.25% of the total number of sales. Lets multiply all sales in KaggleRama by a constant so they are comparable to sales in KaggleMart. If the lines between stores overlap perfectly then trend and seasonality are not unique to the store and we can ignore its effect.
In [16]:
def plot_adjusted_store(df):
    new_df = df.copy()
    weights = store_weights.loc["KaggleMart"] / store_weights
    for store in weights.index:
        new_df.loc[new_df["store"] == store, "num_sold"] = new_df.loc[new_df["store"] == store, "num_sold"] * weights[store]
    plot_all(new_df)
In [17]:
plot_adjusted_store(monthly_df)
#plot_adjusted_store(weekly_df)
Observations:
The dashed and solid lines representing the different stores overlap almost perefectly for all dates.
Insight:
Don't pay attention to the values on the y axis, it doesn't mean anything. The purpose of the graph is only to see if the lines overlap.
Trend and seasonality are not unique to the store and we can ignore its effect. All differences in sales can be explained by a single constant regardless of time.
This means we can forecast the store aggregated timeseries, and then disaggregating the forecasts based on historical proportions
Countries
Lets see if the difference in countries, prior to 2020, can also be explained by a single constant
In [18]:
country_weights = train_df.loc[train_df["date"] < "2020-01-01"].groupby("country")["num_sold"].sum()/train_df.loc[train_df["date"] < "2020-01-01", "num_sold"].sum()

Italy      0.159383
Poland     0.071348
Spain      0.139393
Name: num_sold, dtype: float64
In [19]:
country_ratio_over_time = (train_df.groupby(["date","country"])["num_sold"].sum() / train_df.groupby(["date"])["num_sold"].sum()).reset_index()
f,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20,10))
sns.lineplot(data = country_ratio_over_time, x="date", y="num_sold", hue="country");
ax.set_ylabel("Proportion of sales");
Lets multiply all countries by a constant so they are comparable with Belgium.
In [20]:
def plot_adjust_country(df):
    new_df = df.copy()
    
    weights = country_weights.loc["Belgium"] / country_weights
    
    for country in weights.index:
        new_df.loc[(new_df["country"] == country) & (new_df["date"] < "2020-01-01"), "num_sold"] = new_df.loc[(new_df["country"] == country) & (new_df["date"] < "2020-01-01"), "num_sold"] *  weights[country]
    #plot_country_product(new_df)
    plot_all(new_df)
In [21]:
plot_adjust_country(monthly_df)
Observations:
It doesn't seem too bad, although Poland seems a little off
This means we can forecast the country aggregated series, and then disaggregating the forecasts based on historical proportions
As countries in 2020 behave differently we can dissagregate based on 2020 proportions (i.e. equally).
Country and Store
Lets try doing this to both country and store at the same time.
In the plots we're effectively making all time series inline with the Belgium KaggleMart store by multiplying by a constant.
In [22]:
def plot_adjust_country_store(df):
    new_df = df.copy()
    
    store_weights_ = store_weights.loc["KaggleMart"] / store_weights
    country_weights_ = country_weights.loc["Belgium"] / country_weights
    
    for country in country_weights_.index:
        new_df.loc[(new_df["country"] == country) & (new_df["date"] < "2020-01-01"), "num_sold"] = new_df.loc[(new_df["country"] == country) & (new_df["date"] < "2020-01-01"), "num_sold"] *  country_weights_[country]
    for store in store_weights_.index:
        new_df.loc[new_df["store"] == store, "num_sold"] = new_df.loc[new_df["store"] == store, "num_sold"] * store_weights_[store]
    #plot_country_product(new_df)
    plot_all(new_df)
In [23]:
plot_adjust_country_store(monthly_df)
#plot_adjust_country_store(weekly_df)
Observations
It's not 100% perfect, particularly for Poland, but it seems pretty good.
Insights
We should be able to aggregate store together to make the forecast, and then disaggregate using the ratios of historical net sales between stores to get the actual forecast for each store. Country is a little different as from 2020 onwards all countries are the same, so we can can give all countries an equal proportion of sales, or we can assume 2020 was an exception (probably a poor assumption) and use the countries ratios calculated before 2020 to divide the forecast.
Product
Product requires a different approach
In [24]:
product_df = train_df.groupby(["date","product"])["num_sold"].sum().reset_index()
In [25]:
f,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20,10))
sns.lineplot(data=product_df, x="date", y="num_sold", hue="product");
Product ratio for each date
In [26]:
product_ratio_df = product_df.pivot(index="date", columns="product", values="num_sold")
product_ratio_df = product_ratio_df.apply(lambda x: x/x.sum(),axis=1)
product_ratio_df = product_ratio_df.stack().rename("ratios").reset_index()
product_ratio_df.head(4)
Out[26]:
date product ratios
0 2017-01-01 Kaggle Advanced Techniques 0.277944
1 2017-01-01 Kaggle Getting Started 0.227462
2 2017-01-01 Kaggle Recipe Book 0.188900
3 2017-01-01 Kaggle for Kids: One Smart Goose 0.305693
In [27]:
f,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20,10))
sns.lineplot(data = product_ratio_df, x="date", y="ratios", hue="product");
Observations
The product ratio shows clear sinsidual lines for each product, with a period of 2 years.
Insight
As we have a clear seasonal pattern of the ratio of sales for each product, we do not need to forecast each product individually (or treat product as a categorical variable etc.). Instead we can forecast the sum of all sales each day, then afterwards convert the forecasted sum down to the forecast for each product, using the forecasted ratios for each date.
Conclusions
All this together means we only need to forecast 2 time series:
The total sales each day
The ratio in number of sales for each product each day
Once we have completed the forecasts we can break the forecast down into the 3 categorical variables: Product, Country and Store.
Aggregated Time Series
Lets take a look at the aggregated time series.
In [28]:
train_df = train_df.groupby(["date"])["num_sold"].sum().reset_index()
In [29]:
f,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20,10))
sns.lineplot(data = train_df, x="date", y="num_sold");
This is the time series we need to forecast, the unusual nature of 2020 makes this forecast difficult.
In [30]:
weekly_df = train_df.groupby([pd.Grouper(key="date", freq="W")])["num_sold"].sum().rename("num_sold").reset_index()
monthly_df = train_df.groupby([pd.Grouper(key="date", freq="MS")])["num_sold"].sum().rename("num_sold").reset_index()
In [31]:
f,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20,9))
sns.lineplot(data=monthly_df, x="date", y="num_sold");
In [32]:
f,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20,9))
sns.lineplot(data=weekly_df[1:-1], x="date", y="num_sold");
Seasonality
In [33]:
def plot_seasonality(df, x_axis):
    
    #remove the leap year date
    df = df.loc[df["date"] != "2020-02-29"].copy()

    df["month"] = df["date"].dt.month
    df["day_of_week"] = df["date"].dt.dayofweek
    df["day_of_year"] = df["date"].dt.dayofyear
    #account for leap year
    df["day_of_year"] = df.apply(lambda x: x["day_of_year"]-1 if x["date"] > pd.Timestamp("2020-02-29") else x["day_of_year"], axis=1)
        
    df_no_2020 = df.loc[df["date"] < "2020-01-01"]

    f,axes = plt.subplots(2,1,figsize=(20,16))
    sns.lineplot(data=df, x=x_axis, y="num_sold", ax=axes[0]);
    sns.lineplot(data=df_no_2020, x=x_axis, y="num_sold", ax=axes[1]);
    axes[0].set_title("{} Seasonality - all years".format(x_axis))
    axes[1].set_title("{} Seasonality - not including 2020".format(x_axis))
In [34]:
plot_seasonality(train_df, "month")
In [35]:
plot_seasonality(train_df, "day_of_week")
In [36]:
plot_seasonality(train_df, "day_of_year")
Modeling
We required 2 forecasts:
Total Sales Forecast
Product Sales Ratio Forecast
Total Sales Forecast
Lets revist the graph of sales we wish to forecast:
In [37]:
f,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20,10))
sns.lineplot(data = train_df, x="date", y="num_sold");
There are atleast two important things to consider about 2020:
The number of sales from all countries becomes equal; massively increaseing the total number of products sold.
The impact of Covid, particuraly from around the dates March-May.
I am going to assume the first effect does not change in 2021. The second effect will change, to deal with this I'm going to completely exclude these months from the forecast.
In [38]:
train_nocovid_df = train_df.loc[~((train_df["date"] >= "2020-03-01") & (train_df["date"] < "2020-06-01"))]

Define and fit the model, then make the forecast.

sns.lineplot(data = pd.concat([train_df,test_total_sales_dates]).reset_index(drop=True), x="date", y="num_sold");
The forecast looks okay, but theres room for improvement.
Product Ratio Forecast
We now need to forecast the sales ratio between products for 2021.
The period of the product ratio sinsidual curves appear to be 2 years. So to forecast 2021 I resuse the ratios from 2019. This will carry over some of the noise which perhaps isn't ideal, but it'll work fine for a baseline.
In [46]:
product_ratio_2019 = product_ratio_df.loc[product_ratio_df["date"].dt.year == 2019].copy()
product_ratio_2019["mm-dd"] = product_ratio_2019["date"].dt.strftime('%m-%d')
product_ratio_2019 = product_ratio_2019.drop(columns="date")

test_product_ratio_df = test_df.copy()
test_product_ratio_df["mm-dd"] = test_product_ratio_df["date"].dt.strftime('%m-%d')

test_product_ratio_df = pd.merge(test_product_ratio_df,product_ratio_2019, how="left", on = ["mm-dd","product"])
test_product_ratio_df.head()

Disaggregating Total Sales Forecast
Now we have our two required forecasts, we need to divide the total sales forecast between the categorical variables.
In [48]:
test_sub_df = pd.merge(test_df, test_total_sales_dates, how="left")
test_sub_df["ratios"] = test_product_ratio_df["ratios"]
