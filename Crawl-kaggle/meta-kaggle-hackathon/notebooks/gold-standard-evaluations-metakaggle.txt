"The Meta Kaggle and Meta Kaggle Code datasets offer a unique perspective for studying these "gold standard" evaluations. Each competition that Kaggle hosts represents a challenging problem valuable to the larger scientific community. The progress made in these competitions, as visualized by climbing leaderboards, and the vast amounts of metadata surrounding them, offers a unique opportunity to understand how the industry and community have evolved."

AI Competitions, the gold standard for empirical rigor in GenAI evaluation
Position: AI Competitions Provide the Gold Standard for Empirical Rigor in GenAI Evaluation
Authors: D. Sculley, Will Cukierski, Phil Culliton, Sohier Dane, Maggie Demkin, Ryan Holbrook, Addison Howard, Paul Mooney, Walter Reade, Megan Risdal, Nate Keating.
"In this position paper, the authors observed that empirical evaluation in Generative AI is at a crisis point since traditional ML evaluation and benchmarking strategies are insufficient to meet the needs of evaluating modern GenAI models and systems."
"There are many reasons for this, including the fact that these models typically have nearly unbounded input and output spaces, typically do not have a well defined ground truth target, and typically exhibit strong feedback loops and prediction dependence based on context of previous model outputs."
Recommendations for the Field
"Move away from static benchmarks and towards evergreen repeatable processes. View the steady stream of AI Competitions as a resource for the field. Adopt and improve on the anti-cheating structures from AI Competitions to improve standard practice for GenAI evaluations."
"The many new static benchmarks are appearing on platforms like Hugging Face, OpenML, and Kaggle on a near-daily basis and may serve as the steady stream of novel tasks that the authors described as necessary for the field. While they applaud all efforts to create new benchmarks, they do fundamentally believe that static benchmarks should be considered to have been effectively invalidated once they have been published, and thus it is the time component of AI Competitions that provides unique additional value."
"Without controlled, empirical study the authors shared knowledge into why models perform well or poorly on certain tasks. Openly sharing this understanding is critical for unlocking paths to further progress in this rapidly advancing field."
