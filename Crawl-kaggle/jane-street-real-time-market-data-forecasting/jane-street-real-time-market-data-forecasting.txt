Overview
In this competition, hosted by Jane Street, you'll build a model using real-world data derived from production systems, which offers a glimpse into the daily challenges of successful trading. This challenge highlights the difficulties in modeling financial markets, including fat-tailed distributions, non-stationary time series, and sudden shifts in market behavior.

When approaching modeling problems in modern financial markets, there are many reasons to believe that the problems you are trying to solve are impossible. Even if you put aside the beliefs that the prices of financial instruments rationally reflect all available information, you’ll have to grapple with time series and distributions that have properties you don’t encounter in other sorts of modeling problems. Distributions can be famously fat-tailed, time series can be non-stationary, and data can generally fail to satisfy a lot of the underlying assumptions on which very successful statistical approaches rely. Layer on all of this the fact that the financial markets are ultimately a human endeavor involving a large number of individuals and institutions that are constantly changing with advances in technology and shifts in society, and responding to economic and geopolitical issues as they arise - and you can start to get a sense of the difficulties involved!
In this challenge, we ask you to build a model using real-world data derived from some of our production systems. This data gives a very close picture of some of the things we have to do every day to be successful at trading in modern financial markets. We’ve assembled a collection of features and responders related to markets where we run automated trading strategies and are concerned about having good underlying models. To balance crafting a challenging, relevant problem that ties into our business while respecting the proprietary and highly competitive nature of our trading, you will notice that we have anonymized and lightly obfuscated some of the features and responders we present in the data. These modifications don’t change the essence of the problem at hand, but they do allow us to give you a difficult task that meaningfully illustrates the work we do at Jane Street.
Jane Street has spent decades relentlessly innovating on all aspects of our trading, and building machine learning models to aid our decision-making. These models help us actively trade thousands of financial products each day across 200+ trading venues around the world. While this challenge only presents a tiny fraction of the quantitative problems Jane Streeters work on daily, we are very interested in seeing how the Kaggle community will approach this challenge, and in engaging with you about your solutions to the problem!

This is a Code Competition
Submissions to this competition must be made through Kaggle Notebooks. For this competition, training is not required in Kaggle Notebooks. In order to be eligible for submission, the following conditions must be met:
Training Phase
Your notebook must use the time-series module to make predictions
CPU Notebook <= 8 hours run-time
GPU Notebook <= 8 hours run-time
TPU Notebooks are not supported
Freely & publicly available external data is allowed, including pre-trained models
Forecasting Phase
The run-time limits for both CPU and GPU notebooks will be extended to 9 hours during the forecasting phase. You must ensure your submission completes within that time.
The extra hour is to help protect against time-out failures due to the extended size of the test set. You are still responsible for ensuring your submission completes within the 9 hour limit, however. See the Data page for details on the extended test set during the forecasting phase.
Please see the Code Competition FAQ for more information on how to submit.

Dataset Description
The competition dataset comprises a set of timeseries with 79 features and 9 responders, anonymized but representing real market data. The goal of the competition is to forecast one of these responders, i.e., responder_6, for up to six months in the future.
You must submit to this competition using the provided Python evaluation API, which serves test set data one timestep by timestep. To use the API, follow the example in this notebook. (Note that this API is different from our legacy timeseries API used in past forecasting competitions.)
Competition Phases and Data Updates
In line with the forecasting task, the competition will proceed in two phases:
A model training phase with a test set of historical data. This test set has about 4.5 million rows.
A forecasting phase with a test set to be collected after submissions close. You should expect this test set to be about the same size as the test set in the first phase.
To help you author robust submissions, during the final weeks of the model training phase we will be extending the public test set to include data closer to the submission deadline. Predictions on this extended set will not be scored.
At the start of the forecasting phase, the unscored public test set will be extended up to the final day of the model training phase and the private set updated roughly every two weeks. Submissions will be rescored at the time of each update.
During the forecasting phase, the evaluation API will serve test data from the beginning of the public set to the end of the private set. You must make predictions at every timestep, but, in this phase, only predictions on the private set are scored. (You may predict 0.0 on the unscored segments, if you like.)
File and Field Information
train.parquet - The training set, contains historical data and returns. For convenience, the training set has been partitioned into ten parts.
date_id and time_id - Integer values that are ordinally sorted, providing a chronological structure to the data, although the actual time intervals between time_id values may vary.
symbol_id - Identifies a unique financial instrument.
weight - The weighting used for calculating the scoring function.
feature_{00...78} - Anonymized market data.
responder_{0...8} - Anonymized responders clipped between -5 and 5. The responder_6 field is what you are trying to predict.
test.parquet - A mock test set which represents the structure of the unseen test set. This example set demonstrates a single batch served by the evaluation API, that is, data from a single date_id, time_id pair. The test set contains columns including date_id, time_id, symbol_id, weight, is_scored, and feature_{00...78}. You will not be directly using the test set or sample submission in this competition, as the evaluation API will get/set the test set and predictions.
is_scored - Indicates whether this row is included in the evaluation metric calculation.
lags.parquet - Values of responder_{0...8} lagged by one date_id. The evaluation API serves the entirety of the lagged responders for a date_id on that date_id's first time_id. In other words, all of the previous date's responders will be served at the first time step of the succeeding date.
sample_submission.csv - This file illustrates the format of the predictions your model should make.
features.csv - metadata pertaining to the anonymized features
responders.csv - metadata pertaining to the anonymized responders
Each row in the {train/test}.parquet dataset corresponds to a unique combination of a symbol (identified by symbol_id) and a timestamp (represented by date_id and time_id). You will be provided with multiple responders, with responder_6 being the only responder used for scoring. The date_id column is an integer which represents the day of the event, while time_id represents a time ordering. It's important to note that the real time differences between each time_id are not guaranteed to be consistent.
The symbol_id column contains encrypted identifiers. Each symbol_id is not guaranteed to appear in all time_id and date_id combinations. Additionally, new symbol_id values may appear in future test sets.

You will clearly and conspicuously identify the Open Source license under which such Competition Code is licensed at the time of sharing of such code.
9. DETERMINING WINNERS.
Each Submission will be scored and ranked by the evaluation metric stated on the Competition Website. During the Competition Period, the current ranking will be visible on the Competition Website's public leaderboard. The potential winner(s) are determined solely by the leaderboard ranking on the private leaderboard, subject to compliance with these Rules. The public leaderboard will be based on the public test set and the private leaderboard will be based on the private test set. In the event of a tie, the Submission that was entered first to the Competition will be the winner. In the event a potential winner is disqualified for any reason, the Submission that received the next highest score rank will be chosen as the potential winner. The final leaderboard list will be publicly displayed at Kaggle.com and participant hereby consents to being listed on the public leaderboard if participant’s Submission merits inclusion on the leaderboard. Determinations of Competition Sponsor are final and binding.
10. NOTIFICATION OF WINNERS & DISQUALIFICATION.
The potential winner(s) will be notified by email. If a potential winner (i) does not respond to the notification attempt within one (1) week from the first notification attempt or (ii) notifies Kaggle within one week after the Final Submission Deadline that the potential winner does not want to be nominated as a winner or does not want to receive a Prize, then, in each case (i) and (ii) such potential winner will not receive any Prize, and an alternate potential winner will be selected from among all eligible entries received based on the Competition’s judging criteria. In case (i) and (ii) above Kaggle may disqualify the participant. However, in case of Section 10 (ii) above, if requested by Kaggle, such potential winner may provide code and documentation to verify the participant’s compliance with these Rules. If the potential winner provides code and documentation to the satisfaction of Kaggle, the participant will not be disqualified pursuant to this paragraph. Competition Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any participant from the Competition if the Competition Sponsor reasonably believes that the participant has attempted to undermine the legitimate operation of the Competition by cheating, deception, or other unfair playing practices or abuses, threatens or harasses any other participants, Competition Sponsor or Kaggle. A disqualified participant may be removed from the Competition leaderboard, at Kaggle's sole discretion. If a Participant is removed from the Competition Leaderboard, additional winning features associated with the Kaggle competition platform, for example Kaggle points or medals, may also not be awarded. The final leaderboard list will be publicly displayed at Kaggle.com. Determinations of Competition Sponsor are final and binding.
11. WINNERS OBLIGATIONS.
As a condition to being awarded a Prize, a Prize winner must fulfill the following obligations: (a) deliver to the Competition Sponsor the final model's software code as used to generate the winning Submission and associated documentation. The delivered software code should follow these documentation guidelines, must be capable of generating the winning Submission, and contain a description of resources required to build and/or run the executable code successfully. For avoidance of doubt, delivered software code should include training code, inference code, and a description of the required computational environment. If the final model’s software code includes generally commercially available software that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, then instead of delivering the code for that software to the Competition Sponsor, you must identify that software, method for procuring it, and any parameters or other information necessary to replicate the winning Submission; (b) grant to the Competition Sponsor the license to the winning Submission stated in the Competition Specific Rules above, and represent that you have the unrestricted right to grant that license; (c) sign and return all Prize acceptance documents as may be required by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle, including without limitation: (i) eligibility certifications; (ii) licenses, releases and other agreements required under the Rules; and (iii) U.S. tax forms (such as IRS Form W-9 if U.S. resident, IRS Form W-8BEN if foreign resident, or future equivalents).
12. PRIZES.
Prize(s) are as described on the Competition Website and are only available for winning during the time period described on the Competition Website. All Prizes are subject to Competition Sponsor's review and verification of the participant’s eligibility and compliance with these Rules, and the compliance of the winning Submissions with the Submissions Requirements. In the event that the Submission demonstrates non-compliance with these Competition Rules, Competition Sponsor may at its discretion take either of the following actions: (i) disqualify the Submission(s); or (ii) require the potential winner to remediate within one week after notice all issues identified in the Submission(s) (including, without limitation, the resolution of license conflicts, the fulfillment of all obligations required by software licenses, and the removal of any software that violates the software restrictions). However, in case of Section 12 (ii) above Kaggle reserves the right to request from potential winner their code and/or documentation to verify the participant’s compliance with these Rules. If the potential winner provides code and/or documentation to the satisfaction of the Sponsor, the participant will not be disqualified pursuant to this paragraph. A potential winner may decline to be nominated as a Competition winner in accordance with Section 10. Potential winners must return all required Prize acceptance documents within two (2) weeks following notification of such required documents, or such potential winner will be deemed to have forfeited the prize and another potential winner will be selected. Prize(s) will be awarded within approximately 30 days after receipt by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle of the required Prize acceptance documents. Transfer or assignment of a Prize is not allowed. You are not eligible to receive any Prize if you do not meet the Eligibility requirements in Section 2 above. If a Team wins a monetary Prize, the Prize money will be allocated in even shares between the eligible Team members, unless the Team unanimously opts for a different Prize split and notifies Kaggle before Prizes are issued.
13. TAXES.
ALL TAXES IMPOSED ON PRIZES ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE WINNERS. Payments to potential winners are subject to the express requirement that they submit all documentation requested by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle for compliance with applicable state, federal, local and foreign (including provincial) tax reporting and withholding requirements. Prizes will be net of any taxes that Competition Sponsor is required by law to withhold. If a potential winner fails to provide any required documentation or comply with applicable laws, the Prize may be forfeited and Competition Sponsor may select an alternative potential winner. Any winners who are U.S. residents will receive an IRS Form-1099 in the amount of their Prize.
14. GENERAL CONDITIONS.
All federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations apply.
15. PUBLICITY.
