About the Tabular Playground Series

keyboard_arrow_up
The goal of the Tabular Playground Series is to provide the Kaggle community with a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. The duration of each competition will generally only last a few weeks, and may have longer or shorter durations depending on the challenge. The challenges will generally use fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.
Synthetically-Generated Datasets
Using synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!

Dataset Description
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the BPM Prediction Challenge dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.
Files

2. COMPETITION-SPECIFIC RULES
In addition to the provisions of the General Competition Rules below, you understand and agree to these Competition-Specific Rules required by the Competition Sponsor:
1. TEAM LIMITS
a. The maximum Team size is three (3). b. Team mergers are allowed and can be performed by the Team leader. In order to merge, the combined Team must have a total Submission count less than or equal to the maximum allowed as of the Team Merger Deadline. The maximum allowed is the number of Submissions per day multiplied by the number of days the competition has been running.
2. SUBMISSION LIMITS
a. You may submit a maximum of five (5) Submissions per day. b. You may select up to two (2) Final Submissions for judging.
3. COMPETITION TIMELINE
a. Competition Timeline dates (including Entry Deadline, Final Submission Deadline, Start Date, and Team Merger Deadline, as applicable) are reflected on the competition’s Overview > Timeline page.
4. COMPETITION DATA
a. Data Access and Use.
Competition Use and Commercial are checked: You may access and use the Competition Data for any purpose, whether commercial or non-commercial, including for participating in the Competition and on Kaggle.com forums, and for academic research and education. The Competition Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any Participant who uses the Competition Data other than as permitted by the Competition Website and these Rules.
The Competition Data is also subject to the following terms and conditions: Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).
b. Data Security.
You agree to use reasonable and suitable measures to prevent persons who have not formally agreed to these Rules from gaining access to the Competition Data. You agree not to transmit, duplicate, publish, redistribute or otherwise provide or make available the Competition Data to any party not participating in the Competition. You agree to notify Kaggle immediately upon learning of any possible unauthorized transmission of or unauthorized access to the Competition Data and agree to work with Kaggle to rectify any unauthorized transmission or access.
5. WINNER LICENSE
None.
6. EXTERNAL DATA AND TOOLS
a. You may use data other than the Competition Data (“External Data”) to develop and test your Submissions. However, you will ensure the External Data is either publicly available and equally accessible to use by all Participants of the Competition for purposes of the competition at no cost to the other Participants, or satisfies the Reasonableness criteria as outlined in Section 2.6.b below. The ability to use External Data under this Section does not limit your other obligations under these Competition Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations).
b. The use of external data and models is acceptable unless specifically prohibited by the Host. Because of the potential costs or restrictions (e.g., “geo restrictions”) associated with obtaining rights to use external data or certain software and associated tools, their use must be “reasonably accessible to all” and of “minimal cost”. Also, regardless of the cost challenges as they might affect all Participants during the course of the competition, the costs of potentially procuring a license for software used to generate a Submission, must also be considered. The Host will employ an assessment of whether or not the following criteria can exclude the use of the particular LLM, data set(s), or tool(s):
Are Participants being excluded from a competition because of the "excessive" costs for access to certain LLMs, external data, or tools that might be used by other Participants. The Host will assess the excessive cost concern by applying a “Reasonableness” standard (the “Reasonableness Standard”). The Reasonableness Standard will be determined and applied by the Host in light of things like cost thresholds and accessibility.
By way of example only, a small subscription charge to use additional elements of a large language model such as Gemini Advanced are acceptable if meeting the Reasonableness Standard of Sec. 8.2. Purchasing a license to use a proprietary dataset that exceeds the cost of a prize in the competition would not be considered reasonable.
c. Automated Machine Learning Tools (“AMLT”)
Individual Participants and Teams may use automated machine learning tool(s) (“AMLT”) (e.g., Google toML, H2O Driverless AI, etc.) to create a Submission, provided that the Participant or Team ensures that they have an appropriate license to the AMLT such that they are able to comply with the Competition Rules.
7. ELIGIBILITY
a. Unless otherwise stated in the Competition-Specific Rules above or prohibited by internal policies of the Competition Entities, employees, interns, contractors, officers and directors of Competition Entities may enter and participate in the Competition, but are not eligible to win any Prizes. "Competition Entities" means the Competition Sponsor, Kaggle Inc., and their respective parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates. If you are such a Participant from a Competition Entity, you are subject to all applicable internal policies of your employer with respect to your participation.
8. WINNER’S OBLIGATIONS
a. As a condition to being awarded a Prize, a Prize winner must fulfill the following obligations:
Deliver to the Competition Sponsor the final model's software code as used to generate the winning Submission and associated documentation. The delivered software code should follow these documentation guidelines, must be capable of generating the winning Submission, and contain a description of resources required to build and/or run the executable code successfully. For avoidance of doubt, delivered software code should include training code, inference code, and a description of the required computational environment.
a. To the extent that the final model’s software code includes generally commercially available software that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, then instead of delivering the code for that software to the Competition Sponsor, you must identify that software, method for procuring it, and any parameters or other information necessary to replicate the winning Submission; Individual Participants and Teams who create a Submission using an AMLT may win a Prize. However, for clarity, the potential winner’s Submission must still meet the requirements of these Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.5 (Winners License), Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations), and Section 3.14 (Warranty, Indemnity, and Release).”
b. Individual Participants and Teams who create a Submission using an AMLT may win a Prize. However, for clarity, the potential winner’s Submission must still meet the requirements of these Rules,
Grant to the Competition Sponsor the license to the winning Submission stated in the Competition Specific Rules above, and represent that you have the unrestricted right to grant that license;
Sign and return all Prize acceptance documents as may be required by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle, including without limitation: (a) eligibility certifications; (b) licenses, releases and other agreements required under the Rules; and (c) U.S. tax forms (such as IRS Form W-9 if U.S. resident, IRS Form W-8BEN if foreign resident, or future equivalents).
9. GOVERNING LAW
a. Unless otherwise provided in the Competition Specific Rules above, all claims arising out of or relating to these Rules will be governed by California law, excluding its conflict of laws rules, and will be litigated exclusively in the Federal or State courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA. The parties consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. If any provision of these Rules is held to be invalid or unenforceable, all remaining provisions of the Rules will remain in full force and effect.
