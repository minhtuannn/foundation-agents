keyboard_arrow_up
Companies are sitting on piles of data, including chat logs, PDFs, screenshots, and recordings, but they can’t do much with it. Existing tools are typically built for just one data format, or they require too much manual work. This makes it hard to find patterns, generate content, or even answer basic questions.
Your task is to build a working prototype that uses BigQuery’s AI capabilities to process unstructured or mixed-format data. That might mean pulling up similar documents from a giant text archive, creating summaries on the fly, or stitching together insights from messy, mixed data. Whatever you build, the idea is to solve a real problem using tools that feel like an extension of SQL, not a separate system.
You’ll have access to public datasets, and you’re welcome to bring your own as long as they’re publicly available. The goal is to demonstrate how AI within BigQuery can address real-world problems that go beyond rows and columns.
Whether you submit a demo, a notebook, or a walkthrough, we want to see how you utilize these tools to make sense of data that is often overlooked.
Submission Requirements

The challenge offers three approaches. You must use at least one approach, but you may use two or all three. Submissions are only eligible for one prize. Inspiration is provided for each approach, but should be considered as the type of project that would be considered a great application.
Approach 1: The AI Architect 🧠
Your Mission: Use BigQuery's built-in generative AI to architect intelligent business applications and workflows. Build solutions that can generate creative content, summarize complex information, or even forecast future trends directly within your data warehouse.
Your Toolbox (Must use at least one):
Generative AI in SQL:
ML.GENERATE_TEXT: The classic function for large-scale text generation.
AI.GENERATE: Generate free-form text or structured data based on a schema from a prompt.
AI.GENERATE_BOOL: Get a simple True/False answer about your data.
AI.GENERATE_DOUBLE: Extract a specific decimal number from text.
AI.GENERATE_INT: Extract a specific whole number from text.
AI.GENERATE_TABLE: Create a structured table of data from a single prompt.
AI.FORECAST: Predict future values for time-series data with a single function.
Generative AI in BigFrames (Python):
bigframes.ml.llm.GeminiTextGenerator: Leverage the power of Gemini models in your Python workflows.
bigframes.DataFrame.ai.forecast(): Run powerful forecasting models directly on your DataFrames.
Inspiration:
Build a Hyper-Personalized Marketing Engine: Generate unique marketing emails for every customer based on their individual purchase history and preferences.
Create an Executive "Insight" Dashboard: Develop a dashboard that automatically ingests raw support call logs and transforms them into summarized, categorized, and actionable business insights.
Approach 2: The Semantic Detective 🕵️‍♀️
Your Mission: Go beyond keyword matching and uncover deep, semantic relationships in your data using BigQuery's native vector search. Build systems that understand meaning and context to find similar items, concepts, or issues with incredible accuracy.
Your Spy Kit (Must use at least one):
Vector Search in SQL:
ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING: Transform your data (text, images) into meaningful vector representations.
VECTOR_SEARCH: The core function to find items based on meaning, not just keywords. Can be used with or without a vector index.
CREATE VECTOR INDEX: Build an index for speeding up similarity search on larger tables (1 million rows or above)
Vector Search in BigFrames (Python):
bigframes.ml.llm.TextEmbeddingGenerator(): Create embeddings seamlessly in your Python environment.
bigframes.bigquery.create_vector_index(): Build a vector index programmatically using Python.
bigframes.bigquery.vector_search(): Query your vector index using the BigFrames API.
Inspiration:
Develop an Intelligent Triage Bot: Instantly find historical support tickets that are semantically similar to a new, incoming ticket to speed up resolution time. The bot may also recommend a solution based on past ticket resolutions.
Design a "Smart Substitute" Recommender: Suggest ideal product substitutes based on a deep understanding of product attributes, not just shared tags or categories.
Approach 3: The Multimodal Pioneer 🖼️
Your Mission: Break the barriers between structured and unstructured data using BigQuery's multimodal capabilities. Combine numerical and categorical data with images, documents, and other rich media to unlock insights that are impossible to find in siloed datasets.
Your Palette (Must use at least one):
Multimodal Features in SQL:
Object Tables: Create a structured SQL interface over your unstructured files in Cloud Storage.
ObjectRef: A data type that lets you reference and pass unstructured data to AI models.
Multimodal Features in BigFrames (Python):
BigFrames Multimodal Dataframe: Natively load, transform, and analyze mixed data types (text, images, tables) together.
Inspiration:
Revolutionize Real Estate Valuation: Improve property price predictions by fusing structured data (e.g., sqft, # of bedrooms) with unstructured data from street-level and satellite imagery.
Build an Automated Quality Control Agent: Detect discrepancies between a product's listed specifications, its marketing description, and its actual product image.

2. COMPETITION-SPECIFIC RULES
In addition to the provisions of the General Competition Rules below, you understand and agree to these Competition-Specific Rules required by the Competition Sponsor:
1. TEAM LIMITS
a. The maximum Team size is five (5). b. Team mergers are allowed and can be performed by the Team leader. In order to merge, the combined Team must have a total Submission count less than or equal to the maximum allowed as of the Team Merger Deadline. The maximum allowed is the number of Submissions per day multiplied by the number of days the competition has been running. For Hackathons, each team is allowed one (1) Submission; any Submissions submitted by Participants before merging into a Team will be unsubmitted.
2. SUBMISSION LIMITS
a. For Hackathons, each Team may submit one (1) Submission only.
3. COMPETITION TIMELINE
a. Competition Timeline dates (including Entry Deadline, Final Submission Deadline, Start Date, and Team Merger Deadline, as applicable) are reflected on the competition’s Overview > Timeline page.
4. COMPETITION DATA
a. Data Access and Use.
None. Competition Data will not be provided by Competition Sponsor for this Competition.
b. Data Security.
You agree to use reasonable and suitable measures to prevent persons who have not formally agreed to these Rules from gaining access to the Competition Data. You agree not to transmit, duplicate, publish, redistribute or otherwise provide or make available the Competition Data to any party not participating in the Competition. You agree to notify Kaggle immediately upon learning of any possible unauthorized transmission of or unauthorized access to the Competition Data and agree to work with Kaggle to rectify any unauthorized transmission or access.
5. WINNER LICENSE
a. Under Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations) of the General Rules below, you hereby grant and will grant the Competition Sponsor the following license(s) with respect to your Submission if you are a Competition winner:
Open Source: You hereby license and will license your winning Submission and the source code used to generate the Submission under a CC BY 4.0 license that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code.
For generally commercially available software that you used to generate your Submission that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, you do not need to grant the license in the preceding Section for that software.
In the event that input data or pretrained models with an incompatible license are used to generate your winning solution, you do not need to grant an open source license in the preceding Section for that data and/or model(s).
b. You may be required by the Sponsor to provide a detailed description of how the winning Submission was generated, to the Competition Sponsor’s specifications, as outlined in Section 2.8, Winner’s Obligations. This may include a detailed description of methodology, where one must be able to reproduce the approach by reading the description, and includes a detailed explanation of the architecture, preprocessing, loss function, training details, hyper-parameters, etc. The description should also include a link to a code repository with complete and detailed instructions so that the results obtained can be reproduced.
6. EXTERNAL DATA AND TOOLS
a. You may use data other than the Competition Data (“External Data”) to develop and test your Submissions. However, you will ensure the External Data is either publicly available and equally accessible to use by all Participants of the Competition for purposes of the competition at no cost to the other Participants, or satisfies the Reasonableness criteria as outlined in Section 2.6.b below. The ability to use External Data under this Section does not limit your other obligations under these Competition Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations).
b. The use of external data and models is acceptable unless specifically prohibited by the Host. Because of the potential costs or restrictions (e.g., “geo restrictions”) associated with obtaining rights to use external data or certain software and associated tools, their use must be “reasonably accessible to all” and of “minimal cost”. Also, regardless of the cost challenges as they might affect all Participants during the course of the competition, the costs of potentially procuring a license for software used to generate a Submission, must also be considered. The Host will employ an assessment of whether or not the following criteria can exclude the use of the particular LLM, data set(s), or tool(s):
Are Participants being excluded from a competition because of the "excessive" costs for access to certain LLMs, external data, or tools that might be used by other Participants. The Host will assess the excessive cost concern by applying a “Reasonableness” standard (the “Reasonableness Standard”). The Reasonableness Standard will be determined and applied by the Host in light of things like cost thresholds and accessibility.
By way of example only, a small subscription charge to use additional elements of a large language model such as Gemini Advanced are acceptable if meeting the Reasonableness Standard of Sec. 8.2. Purchasing a license to use a proprietary dataset that exceeds the cost of a prize in the competition would not be considered reasonable.
c. Automated Machine Learning Tools (“AMLT”)
Individual Participants and Teams may use automated machine learning tool(s) (“AMLT”) (e.g., Google toML, H2O Driverless AI, etc.) to create a Submission, provided that the Participant or Team ensures that they have an appropriate license to the AMLT such that they are able to comply with the Competition Rules.
7. ELIGIBILITY
a. Unless otherwise stated in the Competition-Specific Rules above or prohibited by internal policies of the Competition Entities, employees, interns, contractors, officers and directors of Competition Entities may enter and participate in the Competition, but are not eligible to win any Prizes. "Competition Entities" means the Competition Sponsor, Kaggle Inc., and their respective parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates. If you are such a Participant from a Competition Entity, you are subject to all applicable internal policies of your employer with respect to your participation.
8. WINNER’S OBLIGATIONS
a. As a condition to being awarded a Prize, a Prize winner must fulfill the following obligations:
Deliver to the Competition Sponsor the final model's software code as used to generate the winning Submission and associated documentation. The delivered software code should follow these documentation guidelines, must be capable of generating the winning Submission, and contain a description of resources required to build and/or run the executable code successfully. For avoidance of doubt, delivered software code should include training code, inference code, and a description of the required computational environment. For Hackathons, the Submission deliverables will be as described on the Competition Website, which may be information or materials that are not software code.
a. To the extent that the final model’s software code includes generally commercially available software that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, then instead of delivering the code for that software to the Competition Sponsor, you must identify that software, method for procuring it, and any parameters or other information necessary to replicate the winning Submission; Individual Participants and Teams who create a Submission using an AMLT may win a Prize. However, for clarity, the potential winner’s Submission must still meet the requirements of these Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.5 (Winners License), Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations), and Section 3.14 (Warranty, Indemnity, and Release).”
b. Individual Participants and Teams who create a Submission using an AMLT may win a Prize. However, for clarity, the potential winner’s Submission must still meet the requirements of these Rules,
Grant to the Competition Sponsor the license to the winning Submission stated in the Competition Specific Rules above, and represent that you have the unrestricted right to grant that license;
Sign and return all Prize acceptance documents as may be required by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle, including without limitation: (a) eligibility certifications; (b) licenses, releases and other agreements required under the Rules; and (c) U.S. tax forms (such as IRS Form W-9 if U.S. resident, IRS Form W-8BEN if foreign resident, or future equivalents).
9. GOVERNING LAW
a. Unless otherwise provided in the Competition Specific Rules above, all claims arising out of or relating to these Rules will be governed by California law, excluding its conflict of laws rules, and will be litigated exclusively in the Federal or State courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA. The parties consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. If any provision of these Rules is held to be invalid or unenforceable, all remaining provisions of the Rules will remain in full force and effect.

Unless otherwise specifically permitted under the Competition Website or Competition Specific Rules above, during the Competition Period, you are not allowed to privately share source or executable code developed in connection with or based upon the Competition Data or other source or executable code relevant to the Competition (“Competition Code”). This prohibition includes sharing Competition Code between separate Teams, unless a Team merger occurs. Any such sharing of Competition Code is a breach of these Competition Rules and may result in disqualification. b. Public Code Sharing. You are permitted to publicly share Competition Code, provided that such public sharing does not violate the intellectual property rights of any third party. If you do choose to share Competition Code or other such code, you are required to share it on Kaggle.com on the discussion forum or notebooks associated specifically with the Competition for the benefit of all competitors. By so sharing, you are deemed to have licensed the shared code under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see www.opensource.org) that in no event limits commercial use of such Competition Code or model containing or depending on such Competition Code. c. Use of Open Source. Unless otherwise stated in the Specific Competition Rules above, if open source code is used in the model to generate the Submission, then you must only use open source code licensed under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see www.opensource.org) that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code.
7. DETERMINING WINNERS
a. Each Submission will be scored and/or ranked by the evaluation metric, or Evaluation Rubric (in the case of Hackathon Competitions),stated on the Competition Website. During the Competition Period, the current ranking will be visible on the Competition Website's Public Leaderboard. The potential winner(s) are determined solely by the leaderboard ranking on the Private Leaderboard, subject to compliance with these Rules. The Public Leaderboard will be based on the public test set and the Private Leaderboard will be based on the private test set. There will be no leaderboards for Hackathon Competitions. b. In the event of a tie, the Submission that was entered first to the Competition will be the winner. In the event a potential winner is disqualified for any reason, the Submission that received the next highest score rank will be chosen as the potential winner. For Hackathon Competitions, each of the top Submissions will get a unique ranking and there will be no tiebreakers.
8. NOTIFICATION OF WINNERS & DISQUALIFICATION
a. The potential winner(s) will be notified by email. b. If a potential winner (i) does not respond to the notification attempt within one (1) week from the first notification attempt or (ii) notifies Kaggle within one week after the Final Submission Deadline that the potential winner does not want to be nominated as a winner or does not want to receive a Prize, then, in each case (i) and (ii) such potential winner will not receive any Prize, and an alternate potential winner will be selected from among all eligible entries received based on the Competition’s judging criteria. c. In case (i) and (ii) above Kaggle may disqualify the Participant. However, in case (ii) above, if requested by Kaggle, such potential winner may provide code and documentation to verify the Participant’s compliance with these Rules. If the potential winner provides code and documentation to the satisfaction of Kaggle, the Participant will not be disqualified pursuant to this paragraph. d. Competition Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any Participant from the Competition if the Competition Sponsor reasonably believes that the Participant has attempted to undermine the legitimate operation of the Competition by cheating, deception, or other unfair playing practices or abuses, threatens or harasses any other Participants, Competition Sponsor or Kaggle. e. A disqualified Participant may be removed from the Competition leaderboard, at Kaggle's sole discretion. If a Participant is removed from the Competition Leaderboard, additional winning features associated with the Kaggle competition platform, for example Kaggle points or medals, may also not be awarded. f. The final leaderboard list will be publicly displayed at Kaggle.com. Determinations of Competition Sponsor are final and binding.

All Prizes are subject to Competition Sponsor's review and verification of the Participant’s eligibility and compliance with these Rules, and the compliance of the winning Submissions with the Submissions Requirements. In the event that the Submission demonstrates non-compliance with these Competition Rules, Competition Sponsor may at its discretion take either of the following actions: (i) disqualify the Submission(s); or (ii) require the potential winner to remediate within one week after notice all issues identified in the Submission(s) (including, without limitation, the resolution of license conflicts, the fulfillment of all obligations required by software licenses, and the removal of any software that violates the software restrictions). c. A potential winner may decline to be nominated as a Competition winner in accordance with Section 3.8. d.

Transfer or assignment of a Prize is not allowed. e. You are not eligible to receive any Prize if you do not meet the Eligibility requirements in Section 2.7 and Section 3.1 above. f.
