Overview
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

Requirement
Goal: It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. For each passenger in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the variable.

Metric: Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as accuracy.

Submission File Format: You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.

The file should have exactly 2 columns:

PassengerId (sorted in any order)
Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)
Example:

csv
PassengerId,Survived
892,0
893,1
894,0
Etc.

Data
Dataset Description: The data has been split into two groups:

training set (train.csv): Used to build your machine learning models. Contains the outcome ("ground truth") for each passenger.
test set (test.csv): Used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. Does not provide the ground truth; it is your job to predict these outcomes.
Files:
train.csv
test.csv
gender_submission.csv (example submission assuming all and only female passengers survive)
Data Dictionary:

survival: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd) - Proxy for socio-economic status.
sex: Sex
Age: Age in years (fractional if less than 1, xx.5 if estimated)
sibsp: # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
parch: # of parents / children aboard the Titanic
ticket: Ticket number
fare: Passenger fare
cabin: Cabin number
embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
