      "Introduction to greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting\n",
      "Welcome to the third module of the online course “Climate Action Training for the Cycling Industry”!\n",
      "Key lessons\n",
      "In this module, you will learn about:\n",
      "Overview of corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting\n",
      "What are the principles and steps of corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting?\n",
      "Setting the boundaries\n",
      "How do we determine our reporting boundaries?\n",
      "Activity data\n",
      "What are the relevant sources of information to be collected internally and by suppliers for conducting greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting?\n",
      "Measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint\n",
      "What is the general procedure to calculate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to activity data? What role do emission factors play, and how to obtain them?\n",
      "Structure of the module\n",
      "This module is structured according to the key lessons.\n",
      "Firstly, you will learn about the meaning of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions in general. \n",
      "Then, an overview of corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting will follow. For correct greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting, it will be necessary to understand how to set boundaries for your inventory. This is the reason why this has been included into this module. \n",
      "After that, typical activity data for the cycling industry will be described. \n",
      "Then, you will learn how to calculate Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. \n",
      "Scope 3 emission calculation will also be part of the module, however only on a high-level basis. In Module 6, you will be learning more about Scope 3 emissions.\n",
      "Here's what you'll learn about Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions \n",
      "Scope 1 emissions\n",
      "Scope 2 emissions\n",
      "Scope 3 emissions\n",
      "How do we calculate direct emissions?Stationary and mobile combustionRefrigeration and air-conditioning equipment\n",
      "How do we calculate indirect emissions from purchased energy?Grid electricityPurchased steam\n",
      "When and how do suppliers measure emissions from upstream and downstream activities?\n",
      "You can check and apply what you have learned at the end of the module by:\n",
      "Checking your knowledge in a short quiz covering the main topics of this module. Calculating your company's emission in a real-life assignment.You can also have a look at the frequently asked questions (FAQs) concerning this module’s topic at the end of the lesson.\n",
      "How much time should I plan for this module?\n",
      "Going through the core content of this module will take approximately 2-3 hours. The module has been divided into two sessions.For the assignments, set aside another 3-4 hours.\n",
      "Before we start, take a minute to reflect:What are the skills you expect to gain from taking this module? Think about this before you continue. If you like, note down your expectations so that you can revisit them at the end of the module.\n",
      "CONTINUE\n",
      "Overview of corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting\n",
      "As you learned in Module 2, greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting is the process by which a corporation or an organization measures their total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions emitted directly or indirectly from their own operations in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). We refer to greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory as the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of a corporation as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) within specific boundaries, such as a specified time span (usually one year) and specified areas (e.g., all sites a company owns).In the previous module, we recommended following the greenhouse gas (GHG) Protocol as it is the most widely used international standard. To ensure consistency, we will follow the Protocol again for this module. \n",
      "Five accounting principles according to the greenhouse gas (GHG) protocol \n",
      "Relevance\n",
      "Include relevant boundaries for decision-making.In practice, this means establishing greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory boundaries that accurately reflect the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the organization and serve the decision-making needs of internal and external users.\n",
      "Completeness\n",
      "Comprehensive emission sources. In practice, this is related to establishing and reporting all emission sources within the greenhouse gas (GHG) boundaries. Any specific exclusions should be disclosed and justified.\n",
      "Consistency\n",
      "Comparable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over time.This means establishing a process to calculate GHG footprints, including the emission factors used. Use consistent methodologies to allow for meaningful comparisons of emissions over time. Transparently record any changes to the GHG emissions data, inventory boundary methods, or any other relevant information that may affect the data over time.\n",
      "Transparency\n",
      "Implement clear documentation and processes.Transparency is about documentation. Disclose any greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory processes, relevant assumptions and appropriate references to the accounting and calculation methodologies and data sources used.\n",
      "Accuracy\n",
      "Data and calculations should be as precise as possible to reduce uncertainties and ensure the integrity of the information.When conducting greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting, you should collect as much primary data as possible to ensure the accuracy of emissions calculations and minimize uncertainty. This creates credible results for both accounting and reporting activities that help with decision-making.\n",
      "Major milestones for annual greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting \n",
      "What are the major milestones in the greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting process? Let's find out! \n",
      "Click on the arrow to learn more.\n",
      "Setting the boundaries\n",
      "Setting boundaries means that the reporting company determines how to account for its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The boundaries always need to be aligned with the greenhouse gas (GHG) protocol. On the one hand, you need to decide on your organizational boundary which has an influence on accounting for emissions that occur in subsidiary factories or leased buildings. On the other hand, you will need to set an operational boundary. This will have an impact on how emissions are categorized. The details on setting the boundaries will be discussed in Chapter 3. \n",
      "Identifying and collecting activity data under different scopes\n",
      "Next, you identify the emission sources within this established boundary (e.g., the fuel consumption of boilers, company-owned vehicles or purchased electricity, heat or steam). Then, you collect activity data for the identified sources. \n",
      "Identifying conversion and emission factors, and calculating emissions\n",
      "In this step, you first need to identify the appropriate conversion factors and emissions coefficients (also known as emission factors) to convert data to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Then, you calculate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that result from the assessed activities, such as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) released due to the fuel consumption of on-site boilers. The illustration above explains in a bit more detail how emissions are calculated.\n",
      "Now you know which steps to take. It’s time to set up a team with responsible staff to support the process. \n",
      "Possible team structure for greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting \n",
      "When selecting your delegates, consider the following aspects:\n",
      "The responsible staff/team needs to be familiar with the global standards and process of greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting (e.g., types and methodologies of accounting). You can invite your colleagues to participate in this course to build up foundational knowledge.\n",
      "The responsible staff/team will need to work closely with the management and accounting departments to collect primary data. \n",
      "Plan ahead – greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting takes time depending on the scope and activities included. As you will see in the lesson below, data collection and processing can be challenging and time consuming, especially for a first timer. However, once you have established boundaries, emission sources, metrics, and emission factors, greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting for subsequent years will take less time. \n",
      "Before we get into details on how to do greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting, let’s think for a minute who within the organization should measure the carbon footprint? \n",
      "The illustration below summarizes the differences in team structure and it determines the approach taken to greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting (to be explained soon). Let's look at different approaches to GHG accounting in more detail.\n",
      "Figure 2-1 Team structure for GHG accounting\n",
      "Approaches to corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting \n",
      "From the previous session, we understand that for a stand-alone facility, the team lead will be responsible for consolidating all activity data, greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting and reporting. However, for a company with more than one facility under its wings, there are two approaches to greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting and reporting. \n",
      "Centralized\n",
      "Decentralized\n",
      "In this approach, individual facilities report information to the corporate level, where greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are then calculated. \n",
      "In contrast to the centralized approach, here individual facilities collect activities information, directly calculate their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using approved methods. This data is then reported to the corporate level.In reality, manufacturers will probably find a blend of centralized and decentralized to be the best approach. It is common that the corporate group establishes a reporting mechanism or tool for their facilities to evaluate their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This resulting data is then sent back to the corporate group for aggregation and analysis.\n",
      "So what does the greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting process look like?\n",
      "Overview of greenhouse gas (GHG) Accounting Process \n",
      "Appoint staff or create a team that is responsible for data collection and calculating the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint. \n",
      "Define your organizational and operational boundaries. \n",
      "Understand the activity data you will need to calculate the footprint. \n",
      "List the relevant activity data. In practice, you should create a data collection template (e.g., Excel) to capture activity data such as fuel, electricity, or other energy consumption at each site.\n",
      "Processing data (calculation). Recent or updated activity data should be used as much as possible to increase accuracy. You will learn how to use available greenhouse gas (GHG) tools to perform these calculations later in this module.  \n",
      "We will discuss points 2-5 later. \n",
      "CONTINUE\n",
      "Setting the boundaries\n",
      "Let’s start with the first step in creating a greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory: setting the boundaries.The boundaries are imaginary lines that encompass the emissions you want to include in your inventory. Setting boundaries is crucial for identifying and gathering the relevant data. There are two different boundaries that need to be defined: organizational and operational boundaries.\n",
      "Organizational boundaries \n",
      "The first step is to define the organizational boundaries. In general, a company's operations vary in their organizational structure, which may include wholly owned operations, joint ventures, subsidiaries, and many more. If you have business involvement in some operations but do not fully own them, defining your organizational boundaries will help you determine the business units and operations to include in your greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting and reporting. There are two approaches to identify organizational boundaries: \n",

      "A reporting company accounts for emissions according to its share of equity in its operational sites, even if it has no financial or operational control over them. This approach is appropriate for large multinational companies. \n",
      "a. Operational control approachA reporting company accounts for 100% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from operations over which it or one of its subsidiaries has control. This is the approach we would normally recommend, especially for a simple company (no joint ventures etc.) b. Financial control approachA reporting company accounts for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from all operational sites whose cash flows it controls.\n",
      "Operational boundary \n",
      "Once a company has determined its organizational boundaries, the next step is to identify the emission releasing activities to be included (also known as operational boundaries).Examples of emission-releasing activities include the combustion of natural gas in your boiler, consumption of electricity and purchased energy. These activities are commonly classified into three scopes. Let’s recall what Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are. You might remember this image:\n",
      "Figure 3-3 Illustration of Scope 1-3 emissions Source: Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol(opens in a new tab)\n",
      "As you can see from the image, a company can further subdivide emissions data within scopes by source type (stationary and mobile combustion, fugitive emissions, etc.) and activity type (purchased or generation of electricity, etc.). Depending on a company’s business goals, or where the company sits in the value chain, a company can consider whether to account for only Scope 1 and 2 emissions or to include relevant Scope 3 categories for its operations. As this is an introductory course for greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting, it will focus on how to calculate Scope 1 and 2 emissions for suppliers.\n",
      "In summary, if you have a smaller organization where you own all operations, you just start with defining the so-called operational boundaries because all the owned operations should be included in your GHG inventory.However, if you have a more complex organization, for example one with subsidiaries or joint ventures, you need to identify which operations (or share of operations) you need to include. This means that you need to define your organizational boundaries before defining your operational boundaries. \n",

      "What is activity data? \n",
      "Activity data is a quantitative measure of an activity that results in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. They are usually measured in the following units:liters/gallons (e.g., for diesel)kilograms/ton (e.g., for coal)kilometers (for distances)MWh (for electricity)m3/kg (for natural gas)\n",

      "Scope 1 and 2 emissions data collection\n",
      "To calculate your Scope 1 and 2 emissions, you will need information on the consumption of fuel and water from the above activities. Think about: \n",
      "How much did your company spend on gas, coal, oil, or biofuels used for generators, heat-intensive processes, or boilers over a one-year period? \n",
      "How much fuel is used for your company’s owned or operated vehicles over a one-year period? \n",
      "How much was spent on refrigerant purchases for air conditioning over a one-year period? \n",
      "How much electricity was consumed from external providers over a one-year period? \n",
      "To answer these questions, you can refer to fuel invoices, purchase records or meter records.\n",
      "Frequently asked questions about activity data collection \n",
      "In practice, there are also other special cases that may happen regarding activity data for both mobile and stationary combustions. See the example below: \n",
      "The electricity billing cycle does not fall exactly at the end of the calendar month.\n",
      "Sometimes the bill falls on the 25th or 28th of each month. For this, you could estimate the average daily usage by dividing the total usage by the total number of days in the billing cycle and use it to estimate the total usage for the remaining days that are missing from the billing cycle. \n",
      "For fuel consumption records, what if my facility rents the vehicle to other companies for a certain period of time?\n",
      "Depending on your company’s consolidation approach, it would need to be disclosed either as part of Scope 1 or Scope 3 emissions. If your company’s reporting is based on the operational control approach, the time (months) when your company uses the vehicle should be reported as your Scope 1 emissions and the remaining lease period should be included in the “downstream leased assets” category of your Scope 3 emissions. However, if your company uses the financial approach, regardless of whether your company uses the vehicle or not, you would still report it under Scope 1 emissions. For this, you could estimate the average monthly fuel consumption based on the period your company uses the vehicle. \n",
      "My facility owns a combined heat and power plant, and we sell excessive electricity to another facility. Does that fall under our Scope 2 emissions?\n",
      "Only the amount of electricity that is consumed by your own facility should be accounted for under Scope 2 emissions. The amount of electricity sold to a third party should be accounted for under your Scope 3 emissions. \n",
      "My company owns a vehicle fleet for the logistics of products, how can I find the fuel consumption data?\n",
      "(Option 1) Think about who manages this equipment and ask them for the fuel invoices from the last 12 months. (Option 2) Speak with someone from the factory management /purchasing department/fleet management team to provide you with information on the vehicle fleet’s consumption. \n",
      "There are no invoices available for the entire time span. What do you do now? \n",
      "(Option 1) Determine the fuel consumption of your vehicle per 100 km and the distance travelled over one year. (Option 2) Data can be obtained from financial records on fuel expenditures. These records can be used to generate estimates of fuel consumption using data on average fuel costs. (Option 3) Data on distance travelled is necessary and should be available from odometer readings or other travel records. From this, you can estimate the average fuel consumed per unit of distance. \n",
      "To summarize, try to assess the data as accurately as possible. Perfect data sources include bills, logbooks (e.g., vehicle fuel gauge, odometer, etc.) and invoices. A good way to acquire these is through the accounting department. \n",
      "What if I can't get actual data?\n",
      "If you cannot get actual data from bills, invoices, or meter records, you might need to do estimations or calculations. These estimations or calculations should be as accurate as possible. So, if no records are available, make your best estimate but make sure to keep all necessary records of actual activity data to improve your accounting next time!\n",
      "Here are some practical tips:\n",
      "Ensure that all invoices and consumption data are included.Ensure you are collecting data for a consistent period. That would typically be 12 months.Pay attention to different units (e.g., kWh, joule, kilogram, ton, megaton).Avoid digit and decimal faults.\n",

      "Data relating to your operations. Examples: fuel use, electricity use, quantity of wastewater treated, etc.Example: 60 million pounds of biomass was used during the reporting year at your facility. \n",
      "Emission Factor \n",
      "An emission factor is defined as an average emission rate of a given greenhouse gas (GHG) for a given source, relative to the units of activity. For example: Biomass (wood chips) produces 40.58114 kg CO2e /ton on average (Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs – DEFRA). (Note that the units carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) already encompass the combination of multiple greenhouse gases (GHGs)).\n",
      "Conversion Factor \n",
      "Used to convert the units of the activity data to one that can then be used with the relevant emission factor. There are 2 types of conversion factors:Unit Conversions: Used to convert the quantity of activity data to units that can be used for calculation of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions.For example, 1 ton = 1000 kg or 1 Liter = 0.001 m3 Heat Value: Amount of energy generated per quantity of a specific fuel source.For example, 1 ton of biomass produce 14.71 GJ of energy (DEFRA)\n",
      "Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions from biomass (1 year) 60,000,000 poundsActivity Data   :  2204.62368 pound to ton Conversion Factor (from DEFRA)x40.5811 kg CO2e / ton Emission Factor (from DEFRA)=1,104,436.11 kg CO2e\n",
      "If your activity data and emission factor are not of the same units for direct multiplication, you would need to use a suitable conversion factor, as depicted in the calculation above. In some cases, if the emission factor is in terms of kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per unit energy (kWh or MJ), you will need to use suitable heat values to convert your activity data to units that can be used with the emission factor, e.g., if the greenhouse gas (GHG) activity data is available in weight or volume unit such as kg or liter, please convert it into energy unit (kWh or MJ) using the heat value factor. \n",
      "If you are calculating the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions for other greenhouse gases (GHGs) than carbon dioxide (CO2), then you will also need to multiply with the the global warming potential (GWP), as discussed in Module 2., Session 1, section \"Distribution of emissions across the supply chain.\"\n",

      "Frequently asked questions about emission factors \n",
      "Do I need to change/update the emission factors regularly for my calculation?\n",
      "As an emission factor is specific to a unit of activity, it is often updated to reflect any changes in that activity. You need to make sure that you use the most recent emission factors database. The updated emission factors would reflect that. Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and International Energy Agency (IEA) release a new set of emission factors every year, which are applicable to activities that happened 2 years before the reporting year. You can use the latest data set available for accounting and reporting.For example, you can use Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and International Energy Agency (IEA) 2023 database for calculations for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. However, this is not the case for all emission sources, you need to read through the guidance provided by the publisher. \n",
      "How can I decide if an emission factor is representative of my activity?\n",
      "Emission factor providers and users need to provide a clear description of what activities are covered by the emission factor, as well as the data used for the estimation. When reporting, companies need to make sure the emission factors used are accurately representing their activities based on process, technologies, geographies, and timeframe aspects. Most of the databases for Scope 1 are valid worldwide. The reporting company should regularly search for and use the latest available database that best represents the specific activities. \n",
      "I do not know the fuel source of the purchased steam, what emission factor should I use?\n",
      "It is worth contacting your steam supplier to collect the following information: energy source, type of boiler (Combined Heat and Power generation (CHP) or not), energy output (MJ). If this is not possible, one way is to research the common industrial steam sources in your country and use them for fuel assumptions. If this information is unavailable, you could use data for natural gas as it is the most used fuel to produce steam worldwide. Remember, this assumption should be clearly communicated when you conduct the greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting. \n",
      "What information do I need for calculating the fugitive emissions from the onsite effluent treatment plant?\n",
      "You need to answer the following questions: 1) Is your domestic and industrial wastewater treated together? 2) How is the wastewater treated (aerobically or anaerobically)? 3) What is the annual average of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) or Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) level of the influent and effluent? 4) How much wastewater is produced each year? If you cannot answer all these questions, start building your inventory.
