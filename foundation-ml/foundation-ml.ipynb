       "'As a Senior Python Code Reviewer and Quality Assurance Engineer, I\\'ve reviewed the provided code and identified some issues that need to be addressed. Here are my findings:\\n\\n**Error 1:**\\nThe code is trying to split a single file into train and test sets using `train_test_split`. However, this approach is not suitable for a single file. Instead, we should use stratified splitting or simply use the entire dataset as the training set.\\n\\n**Solution:** Remove the `train_test_split` variable and use the entire dataset as the training set.\\n\\n**Error 2:**\\nThe code is trying to load two files (train and test) when there\\'s only one file. This will cause an error when trying to split the data into train and test sets.\\n\\n**Solution:** Load the single file and use it as both the training and testing sets.\\n\\n**Error 3:**\\nThe code is not handling missing values in the `Age` column correctly. The median imputer should be used with caution, as it can introduce bias if there are many missing values.\\n\\n**Solution:** Use a more robust method to handle missing values in the `Age` column, such as mean or median imputation only for specific groups (e.g., by title).\\n\\n**Error 4:**\\nThe code is not checking if the preprocessing steps are applied correctly. We should verify that the preprocessing steps are working as expected.\\n\\n**Solution:** Add assertions to ensure that the preprocessing steps are correct.\\n\\nHere\\'s the corrected code:\\n\\n```\\nimport os\\nimport glob\\nimport pandas as pd\\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder, OneHotEncoder\\nfrom sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\\n\\n# Set root path to find the dataset folder\\nroot_path = \"/Users/minhtuan/Documents/Documents/Work/Hanoi/crawler/all_datasets\"\\n\\n# Find the folder matching the Contest Name\\ncontest_folder = [folder for folder in os.listdir(root_path) if \"titanic\" in folder][0]\\ndata_folder = os.path.join(root_path, contest_folder)\\n\\n# Check file count using glob\\nfiles = glob.glob(os.path.join(data_folder, \"*.csv\"))\\nfile_count = len(files)\\nif file_count == 1:\\n    # Load the single file as both train and test sets\\n    data_file = files[0]\\n    train_data = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(data_folder, data_file))\\n    test_data = train_data.copy()\\nelif file_count > 1:\\n    raise ValueError(\"Invalid number of files found\")\\n\\n# Define preprocessing steps\\ncategorical_cols = [\"Pclass\", \"Sex\", \"Embarked\"]\\nnumerical_cols = [\"Age\"]\\n\\n# Preprocess categorical columns\\ncategorical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[\\n    (\\'imputer\\', SimpleImporter(strategy=\\'constant\\', fill_value=\\'Unknown\\')),\\n    (\\'encoder\\', OrdinalEncoder(categories=[[\\'1st\\', \\'2nd\\', \\'3rd\\'], [\\'male\\', \\'female\\'], [\\'C\\', \\'Q\\', \\'S\\']]))\\n])\\n\\n# Preprocess numerical columns\\nnumerical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[\\n    (\\'imputer\\', SimpleImputer(strategy=\\'median\\'))\\n])\\n\\npreprocessor = ColumnTransformer(\\n    transformers=[\\n        (\\'categorical\\', categorical_transformer, categorical_cols),\\n        (\\'numerical\\', numerical_transformer, numerical_cols)\\n    ]\\n)\\n\\ntrain_data_processed = preprocessor.fit_transform(train_data.drop(\"PassengerId\", axis=1))\\ntest_data_processed = preprocessor.transform(test_data.drop(\"PassengerId\", axis=1))\\n\\n# Verify preprocessing steps\\nassert train_data_processed.shape[0] == train_data.shape[0]\\nassert test_data_processed.shape[0] == test_data.shape[0]\\n\\n# Save processed data\\ntrain_data_processed_df = pd.DataFrame(train_data_processed, columns=categorical_cols + numerical_cols)\\ntest_data_processed_df = pd.DataFrame(test_data_processed, columns=categorical_cols + numerical_cols)\\n\\ntrain_data_processed_df.to_csv(\\'processed_train.csv\\', index=False)\\ntest_data_processed_df.to_csv(\\'processed_test.csv\\', index=False)\\n\\nprint(\"DATA_READY: processed_train.csv processed_test.csv\")\\n```\\n\\nThis code should now be free of errors and produce the expected output.'"
